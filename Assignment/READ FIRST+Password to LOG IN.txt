My assignment start with the firstpage.html

There you can see some infos about what we offer in our school.
At the top there are the two navigation buttons and the sign in button.
About the last one we will speak later.
So at a first glance there is a slide show followed by the main page.
On the left side there is a nav bar which is following you through the page and you can click on it to bring you in each paragraph in the text. The texts i copied them from different pages just for educational reasons and not to publish them. The sama with the photos.
On the right side is the main texts.
If you click the red button it will bring you on the top.
And if you go all the way down there are some infos about the school plus working links to social media. The transition bettwen the main page and the footer has also a hide effect.

Moving to the second page there is a same layout as the first page.

Now if you click on the Sign in button it brings you to a page where you need to put a password to log in into the main assignment and where not everyone that comes to the site can go and modify our forms-lists.

The password is: admin

Click submit. With enter i couldn't make it work.
But i could use some advices!!! They are always welcomed.


Now we are at the headmaster.html
From here on the left side you can see each of the 8 pages we had to build.
The pages are loading in second page inside the page of the headmaster.html.
Thats why you have also the two scrolling bars.

From here you can navigate to each page put your data in the forms and see the list on the right side of the page. When you click on each input then all the data will appear inside the forms and you can edit each one of them and with the submit button will put them back to the list.

I hope you will enjoy my first try to build my own site and i hope what i build is more or less bettwen what you expected from us to build.

Enjoy my site!!!
