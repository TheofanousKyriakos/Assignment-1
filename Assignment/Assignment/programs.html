        <h1>
          JavaScript, C#, C++, Java and Python <br />All Are Top Programming
          Languages
        </h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Asking “which is the best programming language” is like asking about
          the most important cooking tool in your kitchen. Mixer? Spatula?
          Microwave? Cooktop? Measuring cup? Egg timer? Lemon zester? All are
          critical, depending on what you’re making, and how you like to cook.
          <br />
          The same is true with programming languages. Some are best at coding
          =applications that run natively on mobile devices — think Objective-C
          or Java. Others are good at encoding logic within a PDF file, or on a
          web page — think JavaScript. And still others are best at coding fast
          applications for virtual machines or running directly on the operating
          system — for many people, that’s C or C++. Want a general purpose
          language? Think Python, PHP. Specialized? R and Matlab are good for
          statistics and data analytics. And so-on.

        <h1>Top 10 Reasons to Learn JavaScript</h1>
        <ol class="list2">
          <li>
            <h3>It’s the most popular programming language</h3>
            <br />
            We start our list with possibly the most significant reason!
            According to Stackoverflow.com, JavaScript is the most popular
            programming language used by professional developers today. Even
            back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>It’s in your browser</h3>
            <br />
            JavaScript is, without question, the default language of the
            internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof
            since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers
            are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to
            see why JavaScript is so significant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript also exists outside of the internet</h3>
            <br />
            JavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet
            roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of
            things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds
            cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>It’s a Valuable Tool for Game Designers</h3>
            <br />
            Games are a big business today, and developers who know JavaScript
            have that extra advantage. The language’s versatility, power, and
            ability to easily create visual effects make it a perfect fit for
            game developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript is Ideal for Newbies</h3>
            <br />
            Since it’s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript
            spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development
            environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It’s one
            of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add
            for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers
            support and advice.
            <br />
            Also, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who
            want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript
            supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and
            imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can
            apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like
            Python, Java, or C++.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript is Easy to Learn</h3>
            <br />
            Not only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also
            easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts,
            making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level
            languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
              You Can Create Visual Effects and Other Eye-catching Aesthetic
              Features
            </h3>
            <br />
            There’s building a web page, and then there’s building a visually
            appealing web page that attracts the user’s attention and encourages
            interaction. JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to
            easily add cool design elements such as animation, interactive maps,
            and scrolling video. Organizations and clients want web designers
            who can not only put together a technically sound page but one that
            also will lure visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript is Versatile</h3>
            <br />
            Far from being a one-trick pony, JavaScript empowers a programmer to
            handle any aspect of app design. Do you want to do user-side
            (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are
            you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js
            into the mix and you can do that, too!
            <br />
            You can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron,
            React Native, and React. If you’re intrigued by machine learning,
            then JavaScript will help you there as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>JavaScript also Affects Big Data and the Cloud</h3>
            <br />
            JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the go-to standard for data
            exchanges on today’s internet. NoSQL databases use JSON documents
            for record storage; and although JSON plays well with any
            programming language, it does best with JavaScript.
            <br />
            Also, more developers are turning to Node.js to build cloud-based
            apps, a very much in-demand market.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Finally, the Career Potential is Skyrocketing</h3>
            <br />
            With an increasing number of businesses and organizations going
            digital, there is a corresponding increase in demand for developers
            who are familiar with the better-known programming languages. As
            we’ve already noted, that’s JavaScript!
            <br />
            As it happens, there’s also a shortage of good JavaScript
            developers, so you have increased demand in conjunction with a
            deficit of qualified people. According to a report released by
            Devskiller.com, 70 percent of companies surveyed want to hire a
            JavaScript developer. Also, there’s a growing demand for data
            scientists who have expertise in Python. The market for data
            scientists and data analytics is projected to grow by 15 percent
            between 2015 and 2020. In actual numbers, that means 364,000 new job
            openings. Considering how every Python web app uses JavaScript in
            their front end, it becomes clear that the language is a necessity.
            <br />
            Businesses and other organizations that are looking for JavaScript
            professionals are willing to pay well, too! Indeed.com shows that a
            JavaScript developer can potentially earn an annual average of
            $113,643 in the United States.
            <br />
            If you’re looking to become a programmer who can always be assured
            of a stable career and get well compensated for it, then you want to
            learn JavaScript.

        <h1>Top 10 Reasons to Learn C#</h1>
        <ol class="list2">
          <li>
            <h3>It keeps evolving</h3>
            <br />
            Created in 2000 as an imitation for Java, C# may not have been as
            old as other languages, but it has a way of keeping up with
            consumers’ demands and needs. For example, the visual studio is now
            optional to cater to both its fans and critics. With the .net core,
            you can comfortably use c for web application development. You can
            also comfortably use c# to read excel file, which helps you
            integrate external data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Learning the C sharp programming language is easy</h3>
            <br />
            C# is one of the most natural high-level languages to read. A
            programmer needs not to worry about complex tasks since most have
            been abstracted. A function like memory management is .NET’s
            responsibility and not the programmer’s. It is static, meaning the
            program is checked before running. This makes it easy to correct
            errors, thus giving the programmer less debugging responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>A good programming foundation</h3>
            <br />
            Navigating from C# to other programming languages is easy since one
            can relate some of its functionalities with Java and the underlying
            C programming language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>It’s competitive</h3>
            <br />
            Given its authenticity, a programmer with C# skills is highly sought
            after by many large companies. Its community is ranked at the third
            position by StackOverflow where millions of related topics are
            analyzed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Excellent for game developers</h3>
            <br />
            C#’s unity game engine is among the most used game engine in this
            era. It has been used by popular brands such as Samsung and Oculus
            Rift to build their virtual reality programs. Millions of gaming
            developers have used Unity and continue to do so, given that it is
            efficient and effective.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>It’s versatile</h3>
            <br />
            C# has a significant number of settings and functionalities that
            allow it to be the go-to programming language for big projects. It
            can be easily used in mobile applications, software for enterprises,
            games, services related to cloud technology, and you can also use c
            to read excel file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Has an advantageous tough aspect</h3>
            <br />
            Using C# make you toughen up as a programmer. One will eventually
            learn how to find definitions, code references, type power code
            completions, among other skills that ease up a coding experience.
            Ultimately, these skills become more advantageous to one who has
            mastered them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Works with both Linux and Mac</h3>
            <br />
            Microsoft created the C# language as a cross-platform. The .net core
            feature works both with Mac and Linux, meaning you can transfer your
            work across different platforms without having to make a lot of
            changes. Given that the language can run on Linux, one can change
            from using Microsoft to Linux entirely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>It’s been tested over time</h3>
            <br />
            It is now almost two decades since C# was created. It still ranks
            among the top 10 languages, and many employers still trust it as a
            skill that a potential candidate should poses. With it being one of
            the most used languages by Microsoft, you can be sure that it will
            stand as long as Microsoft does.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Still COOL</h3>
            <br />
            The c-like object-oriented language was the easiest way to describe
            C# back in the days before people got fond of its name. It’s always
            cool, in that, it is used to build cool programs, websites, and
            applications.

            <h3>C++ Popularity and High Salary</h3>
            <br />
            C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by
            some 4.4 million developers worldwide. Also, C++ Developers are
            quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs
            in the industry with an average base pay of $103, 035 per year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ has Abundant Library Support</h3>
            <br />
            C++ has the Standard Template Library(STL) that is very useful as it
            helps in writing code compactly and quickly as required. It contains
            mainly four components i.e. algorithms, containers, functions, and
            iterators.
            <br />
            The algorithms are of different types such as sorting, searching,
            etc. The containers store classes to implement different data
            structures that are commonly used such as stacks, queues, hash
            tables, vectors, sets, lists, maps, etc.
            <br />
            The functors allow the working of the associated function to be
            customized with the help of the parameters passed. Also, the
            iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ has a Large Community</h3>
            <br />
            There is a large online community of C++ users and experts that is
            particularly helpful in case any support is required. There is a lot
            of resources like GeeksforGeeks etc. available on the internet
            regarding C++. Some of the other online resources for C++ include
            StackOverflow, cppreference.com, Standard C++, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ In Databases</h3>
            <br />
            There are many modern day databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, MemSQL,
            etc. that are written in C++. This is because C++ is quite modern
            and it supports features like exceptions, lambda expressions, etc.
            Many of the databases that are written in C++ are used in almost all
            of the in-use applications such as YouTube, WordPress, Twitter,
            Facebook, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ In Operating Systems</h3>
            <br />
            All the major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Android,
            Ubuntu, iOS, etc. are written in a combination of C and C++. The
            Windows applications are written in C++, while Android applications
            are written in Java along with C/C++ with non-default run-times for
            C++ support. Also, C++ can be used to develop the core of the
            applications in iOS.
            <br />
            In general, C or C++ are used in operating systems because of the
            speed and strongly typed nature of these languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ In Compilers</h3>
            <br />
            C++ is closer to the hardware level and is a comparatively low-level
            language. Because of this reason, it is used in many compilers as a
            backend programming language. An example of this is the GNU Compiler
            Collection (GCC) which is currently written mostly in C++ along with
            C
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ In Web Browsers</h3>
            <br />
            A lot of web browsers are developed using C++ such as Chrome,
            Firefox, Safari, etc. Chrome contains C++ in the rendering engine,
            JavaScript engine, and the UI. Firefox uses mainly in the rendering
            engine and a little in the UI. Safari also uses C++ in the rendering
            engine and JavaScript engine.
            <br />
            All these web browsers and more use C++, particularly in the
            rendering engines because it provides the required speed that is
            necessary for the rendering engines since they need to display the
            content at an accelerated rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ In Graphics</h3>
            <br />
            Applications requiring graphics such as digital image processing,
            computer vision, screen recording programs, etc. use C++ due to its
            high speed. This can also include different games that have graphics
            as a big part of their structure.

            <h3>C++ In Embedded Systems</h3>
            <br />
            C++ is closer to the hardware level and so it is quite useful in
            embedded systems as the software and hardware in these are closely
            coupled. There are many embedded systems that use C++ such as smart
            watches, MP3 players, GPS systems, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>C++ is Portable</h3>
            <br />
            Programs developed in C++ can be moved from one platform to another.
            This is one of the main reasons that applications requiring
            multi-platform or multi-device development often use C++.

          <li>
            <h3>Java has an abundant API</h3>
            <br />
            Java has an abundant Application Programming Interface (API) that
            includes many Java classes, packages, interfaces, etc. This is
            useful for constructing applications without necessarily knowing
            their inside implementations.
            <br />
            Java has mainly three types of API i.e. Official Java core API’s,
            Optional official Java API’s and Unofficial API’s. These API’s
            overall are used for almost everything including networking, I/O,
            databases, media, XML parsing, speech synthesis, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java has multiple Open Source Libraries</h3>
            <br />
            Open source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied,
            changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open source libraries in
            Java such as JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons, etc.
            that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and
            faster.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java has Powerful Development Tools</h3>
            <br />
            There are many Integrated development environments (IDE’s) in Java
            that provides various facilities for software development to
            programmers. Powerful Java IDE’s such as Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ
            IDEA, etc. play a big role in the success of Java.
            <br />
            These IDE’s provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax
            highlighting, code completion, language support, automated
            refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.
            <br />
            Java has created a base for the Android operating system and opted
            around 90% fortune 500 companies for develop a lot of back-end
            applications. Also, it plays a great role in Apache Hadoop data
            processing, Amazon Web Services, and Windows Azure, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java is Free of Cost</h3>
            <br />
            One of the reasons Java is very popular among individual programmers
            is that it is available under the Oracle Binary Code License (BCL)
            free of charge. This means that Java is free for development and
            test environments, but for commercial purposes, a small fee is
            required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java is Platform Independent</h3>
            <br />
            Java is platform independent as the Java source code is converted to
            byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform
            using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write
            once, run anywhere) language because it is platform independent.
            <br />
            Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows
            environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the
            platform independent nature of Java.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java has great Documentation Support</h3>
            <br />
            The documentation support for Java is excellent using Javadoc which
            is the documentation generator for Java. It uses the Java source
            code to generate the API documentation in HTML format. So, Javadoc
            provides a great reference while coding in Java so that
            understanding the code is quite simple.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java is Versatile</h3>
            <br />
            Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on
            the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java
            has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security
            features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric
            designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.

            <h3>Simple & Easy To Learn</h3>
            <br />
            Python is extremely simple and easy to learn. It is a very powerful
            language and it closely resembles the English language! So, what
            contributes to its simplicity? Python is:
            <ul>
              <li>Free & open source</li>
              <li>High-level</li>
              <li>Interpreted</li>
              <li>Blessed with large community</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Furthermore, in Python, you don’t have to deal with complex syntax.
            If you have to print ‘hello world’, you have to write above three
            lines in Java whereas in Python, just one line is sufficient to
            print “hello world”. It’s that SIMPLE!
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Portable & Extensible</h3>
            <br />
            The portable and extensible properties of Python allow you to
            perform cross-language operations seamlessly. Python is supported by
            most platforms present in the industry today ranging from Windows to
            Linux to Macintosh, Solaris, Play station, among others.
            <br />
            Python’s extensibility features allow you to integrate Java as well
            as .NET components. You can also invoke C and C++ libraries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <br />
            Python has an array of frameworks for developing websites. The
            popular frameworks are Django, Flask, Pylons etc. Since these
            frameworks are written in Python, its the core reason which makes
            the code a lot faster and stable.
            <br />
            You can also perform web scraping where you can fetch details from
            any other websites. You will also be impressed as many websites such
            as Instagram, bit bucket, Pinterest are build on these frameworks
            only.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <br />
            AI is the next huge development in the tech world. You can actually
            make a machine mimic the human brain which has the power to think,
            analyze and make decisions.
            <br />
            Furthermore, libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow bring machine
            learning functionality into the mix. It gives the ability to learn
            without being explicitly programmed. Also, we have libraries such as
            openCv that helps computer vision or image recognition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
            <br />
            Python is largely used in small, large, online or offline projects.
            It is used to build GUI and desktop applications. It uses ‘Tkinter‘
            library to provide fast & easy way to create applications.
            <br />
            It is also used in game development where you can write the logic of
            using a module ‘pygame’ which also runs on android devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Testing Framework</h3>
            <br />
            Python is great for validating ideas or products for established
            companies. Python has many built-in testing frameworks that covers
            debugging & fastest workflows. There are a lot of tools and modules
            to make things easier such as Selenium and Splinter.
            <br />
            It supports testing with cross-platform & cross-browser with
            frameworks such as PyTest and Robot Framework. Testing is a tedious
            task and Python is the booster for it, so every tester should
            definitely go for it!
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <br />
            Python handles a lot of hassles of data. It supports parallel
            computing where you can use Python for Hadoop as well. In Python,
            you have a library called “Pydoop” and you can write a MapReduce
            program in Python and process data present in the HDFS cluster.
            <br />
            There are other libraries such as ‘Dask‘ and ‘Pyspark‘ for big data
            processing. Therefore, Python is widely used for Big Data where you
            can easily process it!
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Scripting & Automation</h3>
            <br />
            Many people only knows that Python is a programming language, but
            Python can also be used as Scripting language. In scripting:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The code is written in the form of scripts and get executed
              </li>
              <li>Machine reads and interprets the code</li>
              <li>Error checking is done during Runtime</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Once the code is checked, it can be used several times. So by
            automation, you can automate certain tasks in a program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Data Science</h3>
            <br />
            Python is the leading language of many data scientist. For years,
            academic scholars and private researchers were using the MATLAB
            language for scientific research but it all started to change with
            the release of Python numerical engines such as ‘Numpy’ and
            ‘Pandas’.
            <br />
            Python also deals with the tabular, matrix as well as statistical
            data and it even visualizes it with popular libraries such as
            ‘Matplotlib’ and ‘Seaborn‘.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Python’s Popularity & High Salary</h3>
            <br />
