        <h1>What is a Coding Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>
          Coding bootcamps are intensive, accelerated learning programs that
          teach beginners digital skills like Full-Stack Web Development, Data
          Science, Digital Marketing, and UX/UI Design. Through project-based
          learning, coding bootcamps get students job-ready for a career in tech
          in about 12 weeks. There are more than 100 coding bootcamps in cities
          across the US and Canada, and ~50 bootcamps internationally. The
          average bootcamp costs ~$13,500, and graduates report an average
          starting salary of $67,000. Since the first bootcamps opened their
          doors in February 2012, this industry has grown throughout the US and
          around the world. Bootcamps can vary in length from 6 to 28 weeks,
          although the average bootcamp is ~14 weeks long.
          <br />Coding bootcamps teach modern, widely used programming languages
          and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and
          PHP stacks. They are also heavily project-based, and require students
          to immediately put their learnings into practice. Students build fully
          functional web-apps, do data analysis and use real dev tools just
          weeks into their programs. In recent years, the bootcamp model has
          extended to other digital skills like UX/UI Design, Data Science, and
          Cybersecurity. <br />Bootcampers graduate from bootcamps with a
          portfolio, an online presence, interview skills and more. Most
          bootcamps help graduates find an internship or match students with an
          employer network – in fact, in Course Report's most recent research,
          83% of bootcamp alumni report being employed in programming jobs.

        <h1>Types of Bootcamps: 4 Models</h1>
        <p>
          Coding bootcamps have different academic models than traditional
          universities which allow them to serve the needs of a variety of
          learners. There are 4 bootcamp models in the space: Full-Time
          In-Person, Full-Time Remote, Self-Paced, Part-Time Career-Focused.
          While the subjects taught are similar across models (typically web
          development, mobile development, UX/UI design, data science, and
          project management), the time commitment, outcomes expectations, depth
          and delivery of curricula vary based on model.
        </p>

        <h3 id="p5">FULL-TIME, IN-PERSON BOOTCAMPS</h3>
        <p>
          These are the schools that we typically think about when talking about
          “coding bootcamps.” Immersive, full-time, in-person – students attend
          class for 40-80 hours each week in a classroom. Immersive bootcamps
          usually last 2 months to 7 months. Classes are held full-time and
          students can use facilities after class to review concepts and work on
          projects. Many intensive bootcamp students put in 80 hour weeks. To
          attend an intensive bootcamp, students must be prepared to give up
          their full-time job and limit outside activities for the course of the
          program. The Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive, Turing
          School's Back-End Engineering Bootcamp, and Codesmith's Software
          Engineering Immersive are examples of this model.
        </p>
        <h3 id="p6">FULL-TIME, REMOTE BOOTCAMPS</h3>
        <p>
          Online Coding Bootcamps almost mimic the classroom experience – these
          are full-time bootcamps that require 40-60 hours per week (this is no
          MOOC)! Typically, online bootcamps will either use pre-existing tools
          like Zoom Pro and build communities on Slack. Schools like Hack
          Reactor Remote, Thinkful's Engineering Immersion, and Lambda School's
          Full Stack Web Immersive are immersive, instructor-led bootcamps. Like
          their in-person counterparts, online bootcamps teach UX design, data
          science, and software development, have outcomes-oriented curricula
          that include one-on-one instructor/mentor guidance, interaction with
          classmates, and targeted career coaching.
        </p>
        <h3 id="p7">SELF-PACED ONLINE</h3>
        <p>
          Self-Paced Online Bootcamps require less of a time commitment each
          week (~10-20 hours) but take longer to complete. Typically, students
          complete curriculum and projects on their own schedule and meet with a
          mentor several times each week. Most online schools also have an
          online community where students can connect with each other. One plus?
          You can enjoy the benefits of bootcamp from the comfort of your own
          home and don't need to quit your job to upskill. Thinkful's
          Engineering Flex and Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track
          are great examples of the self-paced online bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3 id="p8">PART-TIME, CAREER-FOCUSED</h3>
        <p>
          Part-time coding bootcamps usually meet on nights and weekends.
          Students study programming over a longer period of time (~6-9 months)
          and spend 6-15 hours per week in class and another 10-15 hours per
          week on outside work. Students in part-time bootcamps usually hold
          part-time or full-time jobs in addition to class. The goal for a
          part-time bootcamper is typically to land a new job or get a promotion
          at work, but some part-time students' goals are to simply add new
          tools to their resume. For example, a Product Manager may take a
          part-time coding bootcamp to become more fluent with developers at
          work. Examples of quality part-time bootcamps are Actualize's Nights
          and Weekends Course or DevMountain's After Hours User Experience
          Design Course.

        <h1>Am I ready for a coding bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>
          Coding Bootcamps are intensive programs; while very rewarding, a
          coding bootcamp will be stressful and will push you. Before attending
          a bootcamp, consider if it’s the right fit for your learning style.
          Schools look for the following skills in intensive bootcamp
          applicants:
        </p>
        <ul class="list2">
          <li>
            Willingness to work hard – this is particularly important when
            applying to an intensive bootcamp. It’s a huge investment to spend
            40-80+ hours a week over the course of several months to learn a new
            skill. You'll often hear the word grit throughout the admissions
            process, and that's exactly what schools are looking for in
            applicants. Bootcamps want to know that their students are committed
            to doing whatever it takes to succeed for the duration of the
            bootcamp. At the same time, make sure you avoid burnout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ability to problem solve – An intense curiosity and desire to
            problem-solve are vital, because many bootcamps offer limited
            lectures and instead require students to spend most of the day
            solving challenges on their own. During the technical coding
            challenge, your approach to problem-solving can be even more
            important than solving the challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interpersonal skills – Whether it’s called empathy or just “playing
            nice,” a bootcamp is a team sport. You’ll be spending the majority
            of your days learning alongside and coding with a small group of
            strangers. Those that demonstrate a desire to learn from and work
            with others will do well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical chops – Depending on the school. you may be required to
            pass a coding challenge in your interview. If you're not quite
            ready, take a coding bootcamp prep program.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="p4">
        <h1>What type of bootcamp should I attend?</h1>
        <p>
          Acceptance rates at top coding bootcamps are notoriously low (some
          between 3-6%), but that doesn't mean that you're not ready to learn to
          code. Coding Bootcamps are generally upfront about the minimum demands
          they make on their students. Some "zero to sixty" code schools are
          meant to bring beginners into the fold and other "twenty to
          one-twenty" bootcamps aim to help current developers make a leap or
          learn a new technology stack. First, figure out what your own skill
          level is, and then find the bootcamp that aligns with that level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immersive coding bootcamps – Immersive bootcamps usually last 2 months
          to 7 months. Classes are held full-time and students can use
          facilities after class to review concepts and work on projects. Many
          intensive bootcamp students put in 80 hour weeks. To attend an
          intensive bootcamp, students must be prepared to give up their
          full-time job and limit outside activities for the course of the
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part-time coding bootcamps – Part-time coding bootcamps usually meet
          on nights and weekends. Students study concepts over a longer period
          of time and spend 6-15 hours per week in class and another 10-15 hours
          per week on additional concepts. Students in part-time bootcamps
          usually hold part-time or full-time jobs in addition to class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online coding bootcamps – More recently, the bootcamp trend has
          shifted thanks to online coding schools like Bloc, Thinkful, and other
          popular programs. Even if you choose to study online, you'll still
          have options between flexible or full-time courses. Students complete
          curriculum and activities on their own and meet with a mentor several
          times each week. Most online schools also have an online community
          where students can connect with each other. One plus? You can enjoy
          the benefits of bootcamp from the comfort of your own home. Watch
          demos of online coding bootcamps here.
